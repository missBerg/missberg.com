    Envoy Proxy was first created at Lyft to tackle cloud native traffic handling challenges. Later Lyft donated Envoy to the CNCF. Over it's life the Envoy Project has expanded to enable developers to further leverage and benefit from the power of Envoy Proxy.

    Envoy Gateway bringing the ease of configuring and managing Envoy Proxy.

    Envoy Mobile bringing the power of Envoy onto mobile devices.

    Envoy AI Gateway being the latest addition, allowing you to use Envoy to tackle the new era of managing GenAI integration, building upon Envoy Gateway.
